0.80.0  2015-02-05

enhancements
- improved parsing and intergration of X-13 error messages
- checkX13 performs more tests and returns an error report.
- spec-arguments can also be entered as a named list (experimental)

under the hood
- automated tests for all calls in the wiki

documentation
- new vignette sections on user defined holidays and production use
- new example on Indian Diwali in ?genhol
- dates of Indian Diwali and Indian industrial production
- more detailed documentation for ?summary.seas explaining output details

bug fixes
- genhol() can be used inside a seas() call
- arimamodel() shows model as expected

defunct
- slidingspans, revisions, regressioneffects changed from deprecated to defunct

0.70.1  2014-10-02

new features
- support for the HTML version of X-13. The 'out' function displays the output 
  of X-13 in the browser.
- The 'inspect' function is based on Shiny and can be used without RStudio. It 
  offers access to all series that can be produced by X-13, as well as access to 
  the HTML output of X-13.

enhancements
- empty specs can be specified as empty strings. This is more intuitive than the 
  previously employed empty lists (which are still working). Empty 
  strings are also used as defaults and in the documentation.
- improved parsing of X-13 messages.
- documentation improvements.

under the hood
- flags are used when calling X-13. This makes some early g77 compilations for 
  OS-X unusable.
- use of the .udg file to extract summary statistics.
- support for HTML and non-HTML versions of X-13.

bug fixes
- numerical specification of arima.model led to wrong seasonal part.
- restrict start year > 999, to avoid some millenium bugs.
- si-ratio was wrongly extracted if no trend was estimated
- 'series' drops an error if the requested series is not compatible with the 
  adjustment method, rather than adjusting the method. E.g., if x11.trend is 
  requested from a seats model, an error will be returned, rather than switching 
  the adjustment to x11. The old behavior was confusing.


0.60.0  2014-05-09

new features
- views of 'inspect' are now customizable
- 'identify' method for outlier selection by point and click
- demo(seas) for a demonstration of basic functionality


0.50.0  2014-03-27

new features
- 'series' function, which allows the import of all tables produced by X-13 (except composite spec)

enhancements
- new na.action function: NA handling by X-13 (including interpolation)
- 'out' function also reads '.log'  and '.err' files
- improved help pages
- all examples from the X-13 manual are now in the wiki (except composite spec)
- 'static' replicates a wider set of calls
- summary shows decomposition method (X11, SEATS)
- more flexible arima model specification (numeric vectors also allowed)

deprecated
- the functionality of 'slidingspans', 'revisions' and 'regressioneffects' is now part of the new 'series' function. The old functions are deprecated.

code improvements
- code takes advantage of the series function, simplified import from X-13


0.40.0  2014-02-12

new features
- support for 'slidingspans' and 'history' spec
- genhol, a function to generate holiday regression variables
- user defined variable for 'transform' spec
- NA handling like in standard R
- inspect function with model and transform selection, new views

enhancements
- new diagnostical statistics
- summary shows some useful statistics
- monthplot also shows SI ratios
- easier access to X-13 .out content
- regression effects can be extracted
- checkX13 performs a test run
- 'regression' and 'x11regression' specs can be combined
- fewer, more structured help pages
- comprehensive list of examples from the official manual

bug fixes
- quotes in series name are now allowed
- support for unorthodox frequencies (e.g. 2, 'seats' only)
- spaces in folder names on windows are now allowed

code improvements
- uses only standard R functions, no dependency on 'stringr'
- clearer code structure

\subsection{\textbf{seasonal}: R interface to
X-13ARIMA-SEATS}\label{seasonal-r-interface-to-x-13arima-seats}

\textbf{seasonal} is an easy-to-use R-interface to X-13ARIMA-SEATS, a
seasonal adjustment software developed by the
\href{http://www.census.gov/srd/www/x13as/}{United States Census
Bureau}. X-13ARIMA-SEATS combines and extends the capabilities of the
older X-12ARIMA (developed by the Census Bureau) and the TRAMO-SEATS
(developed by the Bank of Spain) software packages.

If you are new to seasonal adjustment or X-13ARIMA-SEATS, you may use
the automated procedures to quickly produce seasonal adjustments of time
series. Start with the \hyperref[getting-started]{Getting started}
section and skip the rest.

If you are already familiar with X-13ARIMA-SEATS, you may benefit from
the equivalent use of its syntax in \textbf{seasonal}. Read the
\hyperref[syntax-equivalence-to-x-13arima-seats]{Syntax equivalence}
section and have a look at the
\href{https://github.com/christophsax/seasonal/wiki/Examples-of-X-13ARIMA-SEATS-in-R}{wiki},
where most examples from the original X-13ARIMA-SEATS manual are
reproduced in R. For more details on X-13ARIMA-SEATS, as well as for
explanations on the X-13ARIMA-SEATS syntax, see the
\href{http://www.census.gov/ts/x13as/docX13AS.pdf}{manual} or the
\href{http://www.census.gov/ts/x13as/pc/qrefX13ASpc.pdf}{quick
reference}.

\subsubsection{Installation}\label{installation}

\textbf{seasonal} does not includes the binary executables of
X-13ARIMA-SEATS. They need to be installed separately from
\href{http://www.census.gov/srd/www/x13as/x13down_pc.html}{here}
(Windows, filename \texttt{x13asall.zip}) or
\href{http://www.census.gov/srd/www/x13as/x13down_unix.html}{here}
(Linux, filename \texttt{x13asall.tar.gz}). My own compilation for Mac
OS-X can be obtained \href{mailto:christoph.sax@gmail.com}{upon
request}.

Download the file, unzip it and copy the folder to the desired location
in your file system. Next, you need to tell \textbf{seasonal} where to
find the binary executables of X-13ARIMA-SEATS, by setting the specific
environmental variable \texttt{X13\_PATH}. This may be done during your
active session in R:

\begin{verbatim}
Sys.setenv(X13_PATH = "YOUR_X13_DIRECTORY")
\end{verbatim}

Exchange \texttt{YOUR\_X13\_DIRECTORY} with the path to your
installation of X-13ARIMA-SEATS. Note that the Windows path
\texttt{C:\textbackslash{}something\textbackslash{}somemore} has to be
entered UNIX-like \texttt{C:/something/somemore} or
\texttt{C:\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}something\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}somemore}.
You can always check your installation with:

\begin{verbatim}
checkX13()
\end{verbatim}

If you want to set the environmental variable permanently, you may do so
by adding it tho the \texttt{Renviron.site} file, which is located in
the \texttt{etc} subdirectory of your R home directory (use
\texttt{R.home()} in R to reveal the home directory).
\texttt{Renviron.site} does not exist by default; if not, you have to
create a file named \texttt{Renviron.site} with your favorite text
editor (on Windows, be careful with the `show extensions for known file
types' option, the extension \texttt{.site} may be hidden). Add the
following line to the file:

\begin{verbatim}
X13_PATH = YOUR_PATH_TO_X13
\end{verbatim}

Alternatively, use the system terminal (on Windows, it's called command
prompt; also, the \texttt{cd} command requires \texttt{\textbackslash{}}
instead of \texttt{/}):

\begin{verbatim}
cd YOUR_R_HOME_DIRECTORY/etc
echo X13_PATH = YOUR_PATH_TO_X13 >> Renviron.site
\end{verbatim}

There are other ways to set an environmental variable permanently in R,
see \texttt{?Startup}.

\hyperdef{}{getting-started}{\subsubsection{Getting
started}\label{getting-started}}

\texttt{seas} ist the core function of the \textbf{seasonal} package. By
default, \texttt{seas} calls the automatic procedures of X-13ARIMA-SEATS
to perform a seasonal adjustment that works very well in most
circumstances. It returns an object of class \texttt{"seas"} that
contains all necessary information on the adjustment process, as well as
the series. The \texttt{final} method for \texttt{"seas"} objects
returns the adjusted series, the \texttt{plot} method shows a plot with
the unadjusted and the adjusted series.

\begin{verbatim}
x <- seas(AirPassengers)
final(x)
plot(x)
 
\end{verbatim}

The first argument has to be a time series of class \texttt{"ts"}. By
default, \texttt{seas} calls the SEATS adjustment procedure. If you
prefer the X11 adjustment procedure (this is what X-12ARIMA does), use
the following option (see the next section for more details about the
syntax):

\begin{verbatim}
seas(AirPassengers, x11 = list())
 
\end{verbatim}

Besides performing seasonal adjustment with SEATS, a default call of
\texttt{seas} invokes the following automatic procedures of
X-13ARIMA-SEATS:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Transformation selection (log / no log)
\item
  Detection of trading day and Easter effects
\item
  Outlier detection
\item
  ARIMA model search
\end{itemize}

Alternatively, all inputs may be entered manually, as in the following
example:

\begin{verbatim}
seas(x = AirPassengers, regression.variables = c("td1coef", "easter[1]",
"ao1951.May"), arima.model = "(0 1 1)(0 1 1)", regression.aictest = NULL,
outlier = NULL, transform.function = "log")
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{static} command reveals the static call from above that is
needed to replicate the automatic seasonal adjustment procedure:

\begin{verbatim}
static(x)
static(x, coef = TRUE)  # also fixes the coefficients
\end{verbatim}

If you are using RStudio, the \texttt{inspect} command offers a way to
analyze and modify a seasonal adjustment procedure (see the section
below for details):

\begin{verbatim}
inspect(AirPassengers)
\end{verbatim}

\hyperdef{}{syntax-equivalence-to-x-13arima-seats}{\subsubsection{Syntax
equivalence to
X-13ARIMA-SEATS}\label{syntax-equivalence-to-x-13arima-seats}}

The X-13ARIMA-SEATS syntax uses \emph{specs} and \emph{arguments}, with
each spec optionally containing some arguments. For details, see the
\href{http://www.census.gov/ts/x13as/docX13AS.pdf}{manual}. These
spec-argument combinations can be added to \texttt{seas} by separating
spec and argument by a dot (\texttt{.}). For example, in order to set
the \texttt{variables} argument of the \texttt{regression} spec equal to
\texttt{td} and \texttt{ao1999.jan}, the input to \texttt{seas} looks
like this:

\begin{verbatim}
x <- seas(AirPassengers, regression.variables = c("td", "ao1965.jan"))
\end{verbatim}

Note that R vectors may be used as an input. If a spec is added without
any arguments, the spec should be set equal to an empty \texttt{list()}.
Several defaults of \texttt{seas} are empty lists, such as the default
\texttt{seats = list()}. See the help page (\texttt{?seas}) for more
details on the defaults.

It is possible to manipulate almost all inputs to X-13ARIMA-SEATS in
this way. For instance, example 1 in section 7.1 from the
\href{http://www.census.gov/ts/x13as/docX13AS.pdf}{manual},

\begin{verbatim}
series { title  =  "Quarterly Grape Harvest" start = 1950.1
       period =  4
       data  = (8997 9401 ... 11346) }
arima { model = (0 1 1) }
estimate { }
\end{verbatim}

translates to R in the following way:

\begin{verbatim}
seas(AirPassengers,
     x11 = list(),
     arima.model = "(0 1 1)"
)
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{seas} takes care of the \texttt{series} spec, and no input
beside the time series has to be provided. As \texttt{seas} uses the
SEATS procedure by default, the use of X11 has to be specified manually.
When the \texttt{x11} spec is added as an input (like above), the
mutually exclusive and default \texttt{seats} spec is automatically
disabled. With \texttt{arima.model}, an additional spec-argument entry
is added to the input of X-13ARIMA-SEATS. As the spec cannot be used in
the same call as the \texttt{automdl} spec, the latter is automatically
disabled. The best way to learn about the relationship between the
syntax of X-13ARIMA-SEATS and seasonal is to study the growing list of
examples in the
\href{https://github.com/christophsax/seasonal/wiki/Examples-of-X-13ARIMA-SEATS-in-R}{wiki}.

There are several mutually exclusive specs in X-13ARIMA-SEATS. If more
than one mutually exclusive specs is included, X-13ARIMA-SEATS would
return an error. In contrast, \texttt{seas} follows a set of priority
rules, where the lower priority is overwritten by the higher priority.
Usually, the default has the lowest priority and is overwritten if one
or several of the following \texttt{spec} inputs are provided:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Model selection

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    \texttt{arima}
  \item
    \texttt{pickmdl}
  \item
    \texttt{automdl} (default)
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Adjustment procedure

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    \texttt{x11}
  \item
    \texttt{seats} (default)
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Regression procedure

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    \texttt{x11regression}
  \item
    \texttt{regression} (default)
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Graphs}\label{graphs}

All plots from Win X-13, a graphical Windows version of X-13ARIMA-SEATS,
are reproducible in R. The main plot function draws the seasonally
adjusted and unadjusted series, as well as the outliers. Optionally, it
also draws the trend of the seasonal decomposition:

\begin{verbatim}
x <- seas(AirPassengers, regression.aictest = c("td", "easter"))
plot(x)
plot(x, outliers = FALSE)
plot(x, trend = TRUE)
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{monthplot} function allows for a monthwise plot (or
quarterwise, with the identical function name) of the data. There is a
method for \texttt{"seas"} objects:

\begin{verbatim}
monthplot(x)
monthplot(x, choice = "irregular")
\end{verbatim}

With \texttt{spectrum}, the spectral density of any series can be
estimated and plotted:

\begin{verbatim}
spectrum(diff(final(x)))
spectrum(diff(original(x)))
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Inspect tool}\label{inspect-tool}

The \texttt{inspect} function is a powerful tool for choosing a good
seasonal adjustment model. It uses the \texttt{manipulate} package and
can only be used with the (free)
\href{http://www.rstudio.com/ide/}{RStudio IDE}. \texttt{inspect} uses a
\texttt{"ts"} object as its first argument:

\begin{verbatim}
inspect(AirPassengers)
\end{verbatim}

Optionally, you can pass arbitrary spec-arguments to inspect. Here, the
maximum of iterations during estimation is increased from 500 to 1000:

\begin{verbatim}
inspect(AirPassengers, estimate.maxiter = 1000) 
\end{verbatim}

The inspect function opens an interactive window that allows for the
manipulation of a number of arguments. It offers several views to
analyze the series graphically. With each change, the adjustment process
and the visualizations are recalculated. Summary statics are shown in
the R console. With the `Show static call' option, a replicable static
call is also shown in the console. Note that the last option will double
the time for recalculation, as the static function also tests the static
call each time (this is a beta feature of seasonal, which allows
intensive testing; it may be disabled in more stable versions).

\subsubsection{License}\label{license}

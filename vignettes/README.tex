\subsection{R interface to
X-13ARIMA-SEATS}\label{r-interface-to-x-13arima-seats}

\emph{seasonal} is an easy-to-use R-interface to X-13ARIMA-SEATS, a
seasonal adjustment software developed by the
\href{http://www.census.gov/srd/www/x13as/}{United States Census
Bureau}. X-13ARIMA-SEATS combines and extends the capabilities of the
older X-12ARIMA (developed by the Census Bureau) and the TRAMO-SEATS
(developed by the Bank of Spain) software packages.

If you are new to seasonal adjustment or X-13ARIMA-SEATS, you may use
the automated procedures to quickly produce seasonal adjustments of time
series. Start with the \hyperref[getting-started]{Getting started}
section and skip the rest.

If you are already familiar with X-13ARIMA-SEATS, you may benefit from
the equivalent use of its syntax in \emph{seasonal}. Read the
\hyperref[syntax-equivalence-to-x-13arima-seats]{Syntax equivalence}
section and have a look at the
\href{https://github.com/christophsax/seasonal/wiki/Examples-of-X-13ARIMA-SEATS-in-R}{wiki},
where almost all examples from the original X-13ARIMA-SEATS manual are
reproduced in R. For more details on X-13ARIMA-SEATS, as well as for
explanations on the X-13ARIMA-SEATS syntax, see the
\href{http://www.census.gov/ts/x13as/docX13AS.pdf}{manual} or the
\href{http://www.census.gov/ts/x13as/pc/qrefX13ASpc.pdf}{quick
reference}.

\subsubsection{Installation}\label{installation}

To install the stable version directly from CRAN, type to the R console:

\begin{verbatim}
install.packages("seasonal")
\end{verbatim}

\emph{seasonal} does not includes the binary executables of
X-13ARIMA-SEATS. They need to be installed separately from
\href{http://www.census.gov/srd/www/x13as/x13down_pc.html}{here}
(Windows, filename \texttt{x13asall.zip}) or
\href{http://www.census.gov/srd/www/x13as/x13down_unix.html}{here}
(Linux, filename \texttt{x13asall.tar.gz}). My own compilation for Mac
OS-X can be obtained \href{mailto:christoph.sax@gmail.com}{upon
request}.

Download the file, unzip it and copy the folder to the desired location
in your file system. Next, you need to tell \emph{seasonal} where to
find the binary executables of X-13ARIMA-SEATS, by setting the specific
environmental variable \texttt{X13\_PATH}. This may be done during your
active session in R:

\begin{verbatim}
Sys.setenv(X13_PATH = "YOUR_X13_DIRECTORY")
\end{verbatim}

Exchange \texttt{YOUR\_X13\_DIRECTORY} with the path to your
installation of X-13ARIMA-SEATS. Note that the Windows path
\texttt{C:\textbackslash{}something\textbackslash{}somemore} has to be
entered UNIX-like \texttt{C:/something/somemore} or
\texttt{C:\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}something\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}somemore}.
You can always check your installation with:

\begin{verbatim}
checkX13()
\end{verbatim}

If you want to set the environmental variable permanently, you may do so
by adding it tho the \texttt{Renviron.site} file, which is located in
the \texttt{etc} subdirectory of your R home directory (use
\texttt{R.home()} in R to reveal the home directory).
\texttt{Renviron.site} does not exist by default; if not, you have to
create a file named \texttt{Renviron.site} with your favorite text
editor (on Windows, be careful with the `show extensions for known file
types' option, the extension \texttt{.site} may be hidden). Add the
following line to the file:

\begin{verbatim}
X13_PATH = YOUR_PATH_TO_X13
\end{verbatim}

Alternatively, use the system terminal (on Windows, it's called command
prompt; also, the \texttt{cd} command requires \texttt{\textbackslash{}}
instead of \texttt{/}):

\begin{verbatim}
cd YOUR_R_HOME_DIRECTORY/etc
echo X13_PATH = YOUR_PATH_TO_X13 >> Renviron.site
\end{verbatim}

There are other ways to set an environmental variable permanently in R,
see \texttt{?Startup}.

\hyperdef{}{getting-started}{\subsubsection{Getting
started}\label{getting-started}}

\texttt{seas} ist the core function of the \emph{seasonal} package. By
default, \texttt{seas} calls the automatic procedures of X-13ARIMA-SEATS
to perform a seasonal adjustment that works well in most circumstances.
It returns an object of class \texttt{"seas"} that contains all
necessary information on the adjustment process, as well as the series.
The \texttt{final} method for \texttt{"seas"} objects returns the
adjusted series, the \texttt{plot} method shows a plot with the
unadjusted and the adjusted series.

\begin{verbatim}
m <- seas(AirPassengers)
final(x)
plot(x)
 
\end{verbatim}

The first argument has to be a time series of class \texttt{"ts"}. By
default, \texttt{seas} calls the SEATS adjustment procedure. If you
prefer the X11 adjustment procedure (this is what X-12ARIMA does), use
the following option (see the next section for more details about the
syntax):

\begin{verbatim}
seas(AirPassengers, x11 = list())
 
\end{verbatim}

Besides performing seasonal adjustment with SEATS, a default call to
\texttt{seas} invokes the following automatic procedures of
X-13ARIMA-SEATS:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Transformation selection (log / no log)
\item
  Detection of trading day and Easter effects
\item
  Outlier detection
\item
  ARIMA model search
\end{itemize}

Alternatively, all inputs may be entered manually, as in the following
example:

\begin{verbatim}
seas(x = AirPassengers, regression.variables = c("td1coef", "easter[1]",
"ao1951.May"), arima.model = "(0 1 1)(0 1 1)", regression.aictest = NULL,
outlier = NULL, transform.function = "log")
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{static} command reveals the static call from above that is
needed to replicate the automatic seasonal adjustment procedure:

\begin{verbatim}
static(m)
static(m, coef = TRUE)  # also fixes the coefficients
\end{verbatim}

If you are using RStudio, the \texttt{inspect} command offers a way to
analyze and modify a seasonal adjustment procedure (see the section
below for details):

\begin{verbatim}
inspect(m)
\end{verbatim}

\hyperdef{}{syntax-equivalence-to-x-13arima-seats}{\subsubsection{Syntax
equivalence to
X-13ARIMA-SEATS}\label{syntax-equivalence-to-x-13arima-seats}}

The X-13ARIMA-SEATS syntax uses \emph{specs} and \emph{arguments}, with
each spec optionally containing some arguments. For details, see the
\href{http://www.census.gov/ts/x13as/docX13AS.pdf}{manual}. These
spec-argument combinations can be added to \texttt{seas} by separating
spec and argument by a dot (\texttt{.}). For example, in order to set
the `variables' argument of the `regression' spec equal to \texttt{td}
and \texttt{ao1999.jan}, the input to \texttt{seas} looks like this:

\begin{verbatim}
m <- seas(AirPassengers, regression.variables = c("td", "ao1955.jan"))
\end{verbatim}

Note that R vectors may be used as an input. If a spec is added without
any arguments, the spec should be set equal to an empty \texttt{list()}.
Several defaults of \texttt{seas} are empty lists, such as the default
\texttt{seats = list()}. See the help page (\texttt{?seas}) for more
details on the defaults.

It is possible to manipulate almost all inputs to X-13ARIMA-SEATS in
this way. For instance, example 1 in section 7.1 from the
\href{http://www.census.gov/ts/x13as/docX13AS.pdf}{manual},

\begin{verbatim}
series { title  =  "Quarterly Grape Harvest" start = 1950.1
       period =  4
       data  = (8997 9401 ... 11346) }
arima { model = (0 1 1) }
estimate { }
\end{verbatim}

translates to R in the following way:

\begin{verbatim}
seas(AirPassengers,
     x11 = list(),
     arima.model = "(0 1 1)"
)
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{seas} takes care of the `series' spec, and no input beside the
time series has to be provided. As \texttt{seas} uses the SEATS
procedure by default, the use of X11 has to be specified manually. When
the `x11' spec is added as an input (like above), the mutually exclusive
and default `seats' spec is automatically disabled. With
\texttt{arima.model}, an additional spec-argument is added to the input
of X-13ARIMA-SEATS. As the spec cannot be used in the same call as the
`automdl' spec, the latter is automatically disabled. The best way to
learn about the relationship between the syntax of X-13ARIMA-SEATS and
\emph{seasonal} is to study the comprehensive list of examples in the
\href{https://github.com/christophsax/seasonal/wiki/Examples-of-X-13ARIMA-SEATS-in-R}{wiki}.

There are several mutually exclusive specs in X-13ARIMA-SEATS. If more
than one mutually exclusive specs is included, a set of priority rule is
followed, where the lower priority is overwritten by the higher
priority:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Model selection

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    \texttt{arima}
  \item
    \texttt{pickmdl}
  \item
    \texttt{automdl} (default)
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Adjustment procedure

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    \texttt{x11}
  \item
    \texttt{seats} (default)
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Graphs}\label{graphs}

There are several graphical tools to analyze a \texttt{seas} model. The
main plot function draws the seasonally adjusted and unadjusted series,
as well as the outliers. Optionally, it also draws the trend of the
seasonal decomposition:

\begin{verbatim}
m <- seas(AirPassengers, regression.aictest = c("td", "easter"))
plot(m)
plot(m, outliers = FALSE)
plot(m, trend = TRUE)
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{monthplot} function allows for a monthwise plot (or
quarterwise, with the same function name) of the seasonal and the SI
component:

\begin{verbatim}
monthplot(m)
monthplot(m, choice = "irregular")
\end{verbatim}

Also, many standard R function can be used to analyze a \texttt{"seas"}
model:

\begin{verbatim}
pacf(resid(m))
spectrum(diff(resid(m)))
plot(density(resid(m)))
qqnorm(resid(m))
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Diagnostical
re-evaluation}\label{diagnostical-re-evaluation}

For diagnostical purposes, some functions re-evaluate a \texttt{"seas"}
object and capture the full content or parts of the \texttt{.out} file
from X-13ARIMA-SEATS. Re-evaluation on demand saves computing time and
reduces the size of a \texttt{"seas"} object.

The \texttt{out} function shows the full content of the \texttt{.out}
file from X-13ARIMA-SEATS in a console viewer. It can also be searched
for an arbitary term:

\begin{verbatim}
out(m)
out(m, search = "regARIMA model residuals")
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{slidingspans} and \texttt{revisions} function call the
`slidingspans' and `history' spec of X-13ARIMA-SEATS and show the
corresponding parts of the \texttt{.out} file. Note that against the
convention, the `history' spec is called by the differently named
function \texttt{revisions}, in order to avoid a naming collision with
the function from the preloaded \texttt{utils} pacakge.
\texttt{slidingspans} analyzes the stability of a seasonal adjustment,
\texttt{revisions} computes an out-of-sample revision history. A
\texttt{plot} method shows a graphical overview of the analysis. For a
detailed description of the two specs, consider section 7.16 and 7.8 in
the \href{http://www.census.gov/ts/x13as/docX13AS.pdf}{manual}.

\begin{verbatim}
slidingspans(m)
plot(slidingspans(m))

revisions(m)
plot(revisions(m))
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Inspect tool}\label{inspect-tool}

The \texttt{inspect} function is a powerful tool for choosing a good
seasonal adjustment model. It uses the \texttt{manipulate} package and
can only be used with the (free)
\href{http://www.rstudio.com/ide/}{RStudio IDE}. The goal of
\texttt{inspect} is to summarize all relevant options, plots and
statistics that should be usually considered. \texttt{inspect} uses a
\texttt{"seas"} object as its only argument:

\begin{verbatim}
inspect(m)
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{inspect} function opens an interactive window that allows
for the manipulation of a number of arguments. It offers several views
to analyze the series graphically. With each change, the adjustment
process and the visualizations are recalculated. Summary statics are
shown in the R console.

With the `Show static call' option, a replicable static call is also
shown in the console. Note that this option will double the time for
recalculation, as the static function also tests the static call each
time.

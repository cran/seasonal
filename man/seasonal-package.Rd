\title{seasonal: R interface to X-13ARIMA-SEATS}
\description{
seasonal is an easy-to-use and (almost) full-featured
  R-interface to X-13ARIMA-SEATS, the newest seasonal adjustment software
  developed by the United States Census Bureau. X-13ARIMA-SEATS combines and
  extends the capabilities of the older X-12ARIMA (developed by the Census
  Bureau) and TRAMO-SEATS (developed by the Bank of Spain).

  The best way to start is to have a look at the vignette, where installation
  and usage is described.
